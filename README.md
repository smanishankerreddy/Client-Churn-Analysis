# Client-Churn-Analysis
Project: Energy Client Churn & Consumption Modeling
Author: Manishankerreddy Sanampudi
Tools Used: Python Â· Pandas Â· Seaborn Â· Matplotlib Â· Scikit-learn Â· Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“¬ Scenario
A utility provider shared two datasets:

client_data.csv â€“ containing electricity/gas consumption history, margin metrics, product engagement, and churn labels

price_data.csv â€“ containing dynamic pricing for off-peak, peak, and mid-peak periods over time

The client requested a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand:

What features are most predictive of churn?

Do consumption habits affect customer retention?

How does pricing variability influence contract cancellations?

Can we identify segments based on margin and product engagement?

ðŸ”§ Workflow Overview
1. Data Import & Initial Exploration
Loaded both client_data.csv and price_data.csv

Merged datasets using id for alignment of client and pricing data

Checked for null values, inconsistent formats, and outliers

2. Feature Understanding
Based on the Data Description.pdf, columns include:

Consumption patterns: cons_12m, forecast_cons_12m, imp_cons

Margin indicators: net_margin, margin_net_pow_ele

Temporal features: contract start, end, and renewal dates

Flags: has_gas, nb_prod_act, churn

3. EDA & Visualization
Correlation matrix to identify strongest predictors of churn

Histogram and boxplot visualizations of margin vs churn

Trend analysis on num_years_antig, pow_max, and nb_prod_act

Clustered plots by channel_sales and origin_up to detect segment behavior

4. Insights & Initial Observations
Clients with low net margins and short contract antiquity tend to churn more

Gas users exhibit different churn patterns than electricity-only clients

Forecast accuracy vs actual consumption has a churn impact

Seasonal pricing variability (peak/off-peak) aligns with churn spikes

ðŸ“ˆ Outcome
The EDA helped build a foundation for future churn prediction models. Key features were shortlisted for modeling based on:

High correlation with churn

Business interpretability

Low data sparsity

The client is now positioned to proceed with supervised learning to predict churn probability and strategize retention efforts.
